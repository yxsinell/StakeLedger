# Test Design Principles

> **Purpose**: Defines the testing philosophy, ATC rules, and test structure conventions for the KATA (Component Action Test Architecture).
> **Audience**: AI agents and team members writing automated tests.
> **Rule**: Always read this file before writing any test code or creating ATCs.

---

## Quick Summary

1. **ATCs are ACTIONS, not reads.** A simple GET is a helper, not an ATC.
2. **A TC is defined by its Precondition + Action.** All expected results from the same precondition and action belong to the same TC — regardless of which panel, endpoint, or UI section they validate.
3. **Tests validate complete FLOWS, not individual properties.** Don't create 6 tests checking 6 fields of the same response.
4. **Test names use verbs.** Files: camelCase with a verb. Tests: `should [behavior] when [condition]`.
5. **ATCs are equivalent partitions.** Same ATC with different data must produce the same type of output. Conditionals are allowed sparingly for slight output variations; truly different behavior requires a separate ATC.
6. **Assertions are micro-validations during a flow**, not standalone tests.

---

## 1. What is an ATC (and What is NOT)

### ATC = An Action in the System

An ATC (Acceptance Test Case) represents a **complete action** that changes or validates system state. It maps 1:1 with a test case ticket in your issue tracker (Jira, Xray, etc.) via the `@atc('TICKET-ID')` decorator, where the ID is the real issue ID (e.g., `TK-101`, `UPEX-456`).

**An ATC is:**
- An action the user or system performs (create, update, delete, submit, import)
- A complete mini-flow with actions + assertions
- An equivalent partition: same ATC with different inputs always produces the same output type
- Reusable across multiple tests and steps

**When is it the SAME ATC vs a DIFFERENT ATC?**

| Same ATC (parameterize) | Different ATC (create new) |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Different **data** but same **behavior** | Different **actions** or **behavior** |
| All inputs produce the same output type | Outputs are fundamentally different |
| Example: buy 1 product vs buy 5 products (same checkout flow) | Example: checkout with credit card vs checkout with bank transfer (different steps) |
| Minor output variation → use conditionals sparingly | Different endpoint, different UI flow, or different assertions |

**Rule of thumb**: If the **actions** inside the ATC change, it's a different ATC. If only the **data** changes but the system behaves identically, it's the same ATC with parameterized input.

### TC Identity Rule: Precondition + Action

A Test Case's identity is determined by exactly two elements:

1. **Precondition**: The state the system must be in before the test
2. **Action**: What the user does (the trigger)

**All expected results** that follow from the same precondition + action are assertions within the **same TC**. This holds true regardless of which panel, section, endpoint, or UI area the assertion validates.

```
TC Identity = Precondition + Action
              ↓
              All expected outputs are assertions of THIS TC
```

#### Why This Matters

When designing tests, the natural instinct is to organize by **concern** (pricing block, reviews block, inventory block). But this leads to multiple TCs that share the same precondition and action — which means duplicated test execution, duplicated setup, and fundamentally: the same test split across multiple tickets.

#### Anti-Pattern: Splitting by Concern

```
// WRONG: 3 separate TCs for the same input
TC-A: Open published product → verify Pricing block values
TC-B: Open published product → verify Reviews block values
TC-C: Open published product → verify detail page structure

// These share the SAME precondition (product is published and in stock)
// and the SAME action (open product detail page)
// → They are the SAME TC with different assertions
```

#### Correct Approach: One TC, All Assertions

```
// CORRECT: One TC with all expected results listed
TC: Open product detail page for published in-stock product
  Precondition: Product is published and has stock > 0
  Action: User navigates to the product detail page
  Expected Output:
    - Page structure visible ("Product Details" heading, image gallery, Reviews section)
    - Pricing values correct (Base - Discount = Final price)
    - Inventory metrics correct (stock count, delivery estimate)
    - Add to Cart button enabled
    - Reviews block shows rating + review count
    - "Out of Stock" and "Unavailable" banners NOT visible
```

#### When IS It a Different TC?

A TC is different when the **precondition** or **action** changes — not when you want to check a different aspect of the output:

| Different TC? | Reason |
|--------------|--------|
| Yes | Different **precondition**: product out of stock vs product in stock |
| Yes | Different **action**: open product detail vs click "Add to Cart" |
| Yes | Different **equivalent partition**: percentage discount vs fixed-amount discount |
| **No** | Same precondition + same action, but checking pricing block vs reviews block |
| **No** | Same precondition + same action, but checking one more field in the response |

**An ATC is NOT:**
- A simple GET endpoint that retrieves data
- A single assertion on one field
- A wrapper around one Playwright action (click, fill, navigate)

### Helpers vs ATCs

| Type | What It Does | Example | Has `@atc` Decorator |
|------|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| **Helper** | Retrieves data (read-only, no state change) | `getOrders(filters)`, `getCurrentUser()` | No |
| **ATC** | Performs an action that changes system state | `authenticateSuccessfully()`, `createOrderSuccessfully()` | Yes |

### Edge Case: Authorization/Security GETs

A GET that validates access control (e.g., `GET /admin` returning 403) is still a **helper**, not an ATC. The ATC is the action that establishes the context; the GET serves as verification inside it.

```
ATC: loginWithRestrictedRole(credentials)
  1. POST /auth/login with restricted user (the ACTION)
  2. GET /admin → expects 403            (VERIFICATION that access is denied)
  3. Assertions: 403 status, error message
```

The GET alone doesn't change system state — it only confirms the outcome of the login action. This rule applies to all authorization checks (401, 403).

### When a GET Belongs Inside an ATC

A GET is valid **inside** an ATC when it serves as a verification step after an action:

```
ATC: createOrderSuccessfully(orderData)
  1. POST /orders (the ACTION)
  2. GET /orders/{id}           (VERIFICATION that the order was persisted)
  3. Assertions on both responses
```

The GET is not a standalone ATC. It exists to verify the action succeeded. This is similar to how a user would perform an action in the UI and then visually verify the result on screen.

### Incorrect ATC Examples (Should Be Helpers)

```
// WRONG: These are helpers, not ATCs
@atc('TK-103')
async getCurrentUserSuccessfully() { ... }  // Just a GET, no action

@atc('TK-104')
async getCurrentUserUnauthorized() { ... }  // Just a GET, no action
```

### Correct ATC Examples

```
// RIGHT: These are real actions in the system
@atc('TK-101')
async authenticateSuccessfully(credentials) {
  // ACTION: POST to login
  // VERIFICATION: GET /auth/me to confirm session is valid
  // ASSERTIONS: token defined, user info matches
}

@atc('TK-102')
async loginWithInvalidCredentials(credentials) {
  // ACTION: POST to login with bad creds
  // VERIFICATION: GET /auth/me returns 401 (proves session was NOT created)
  // ASSERTIONS: error response, no token, no session
}
```

Notice how `getCurrentUserOK` should be absorbed INTO `authenticateSuccessfully` as a verification step, and `getCurrentUser401` should be absorbed INTO `loginWithInvalidCredentials`.

### ATC Structure

```
ATC method:
  1. Preconditions: received via parameters (implicit, not internal setup)
  2. Actions: the actual operations (POST, PUT, clicks, form submissions)
  3. Verification: optional GET or page check to confirm the action worked
  4. Assertions: fixed assertions that validate the expected outcome
  5. Return: data for chaining ([response, body, payload] for API, void for UI)
```

### ATC Naming Convention

Format: `{verb}{Resource}{Scenario}`

- Success: `authenticateSuccessfully`, `createOrderSuccessfully`
- Error: `loginWithInvalidCredentials`, `createOrderWithInvalidPayload`
- The name must clearly describe WHAT ACTION is being performed and WHAT OUTCOME is expected

---

## 2. Helpers in Components

Helpers are public methods in components that retrieve data without performing actions. They do NOT have the `@atc` decorator.

**Placement**: At the top of the component file, before ATCs.

```
OrdersApi.ts:
  // --- Helpers (no @atc decorator) ---
  getOrders(filters)             → GET /orders
  getOrderById(id)               → GET /orders/{id}
  getTotals(filters)             → GET /orders/totals
  getStatus(orderId)             → GET /orders/{id}/status

  // --- ATCs (@atc decorator) ---
  @atc('TK-201')
  createOrderSuccessfully(orderData) → POST /orders + GET verification
```

Helpers can be called:
- Inside ATCs as verification steps
- Inside test files for preconditions or assertions
- Inside steps for setup chains

---

## 3. Test File Design

### File Naming

- **Format**: camelCase with a verb that describes what the test validates
- **Location**: `tests/integration/{module}/` or `tests/e2e/{module}/`

| Pattern | Example | Why |
|---------|---------|-----|
| `{verb}{Feature}.test.ts` | `createOrder.test.ts` | Verb makes the purpose clear |
| `{verb}{Feature}.test.ts` | `applyDiscount.test.ts` | You know exactly what it tests |
| `{verb}{Feature}.test.ts` | `refreshCatalog.test.ts` | Action-oriented naming |

**Avoid generic names** like `orderFlow.test.ts` (no verb, too broad) or `userSession.test.ts` (what about the session?).

### Describe Block

The `describe` block name should match the file purpose. It can optionally include the ticket ID when the file is tied to a single ticket:

```typescript
// File: applyDiscount.test.ts
test.describe('TK-411: Apply Discount Code', () => {
  test('TK-411: should apply percentage discount when code is valid', ...)
  test('TK-411: should apply fixed-amount discount when code is valid', ...)
  test('TK-411: should reject discount when code has expired', ...)
});
```

### Test Naming Convention

Every `test()` must have the ticket ID as a prefix, followed by the behavior description.

Format: `TK-XXX: should [behavior] when [condition]`

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `should` | Always starts with "should" | `should` |
| `[behavior]` | Verb + expected outcome | `apply percentage discount` |
| `when [condition]` | The specific scenario | `when the discount code is valid` |

More examples:
- `should calculate final price correctly when discount is applied`
- `should set isOutOfStock to true when inventory drops to 0`
- `should NOT allow checkout when cart is empty`
- `should apply tax when shipping address is in a taxable region`
- `should reject state transition when skipping from State 1 to State 3`

---

## 4. Tests Validate FLOWS, Not Individual Properties

This section is the code-level application of the **TC Identity Rule** (Section 1). Just as a TC is defined by Precondition + Action at the design level, a test at the code level should validate ALL expected outputs of a given flow — not split them across multiple tests.

### The Anti-Pattern (WRONG)

```typescript
// WRONG: 6 tests checking 6 properties of the same response
test('should return orders', async ({ api }) => {
  const orders = await api.orders.getOrders(filters);
  expect(orders.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});

test('should have referenceNumber', async ({ api }) => {
  const orders = await api.orders.getOrders(filters);  // same call!
  expect(orders[0].referenceNumber).toBeDefined();
});

test('should have totalAmount', async ({ api }) => {
  const orders = await api.orders.getOrders(filters);  // same call again!
  expect(orders[0].totalAmount).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});
```

This is wrong because:
- All 3 tests make the same API call
- All 3 tests check the same response
- If one fails, the others probably fail too
- No value in separating them

### The Correct Approach

```typescript
// RIGHT: One test validates the complete flow with multiple assertions
test('TK-XXX: should create order with correct totals when discount is applied', async ({ api }) => {
  // Preconditions
  // ... setup data via API

  // Action + Verification (through ATCs and helpers)
  const [, order] = await api.orders.createOrderSuccessfully(orderData);
  const totals = await api.orders.getTotals({ orderId: order.id });

  // Multiple assertions validating the COMPLETE contract
  expect(order.id).toBeDefined();
  expect(order.referenceNumber).toBeDefined();
  expect(order.discountApplied).toBe(true);
  expect(totals.finalAmount).toBe(totals.baseAmount - totals.discountAmount);
  // ... all related validations in one place
});
```

### When to Separate Tests

Only create separate tests when the **scenario is fundamentally different**:

| Separate Test? | Reason |
|---------------|--------|
| Yes | Different flow (positive vs negative) |
| Yes | Different preconditions that change the outcome |
| Yes | Different user role or permissions |
| No | Same flow, different field assertions |
| No | Same response, different property checks |

Example of correctly separated tests:

```typescript
test.describe('TK-411: Apply Discount Code', () => {
  // Scenario 1: Valid percentage code (different precondition → different outcome)
  test('TK-411: should apply percentage discount when code is valid', ...)

  // Scenario 2: Valid fixed-amount code (different precondition → different outcome)
  test('TK-411: should apply fixed-amount discount when code is valid', ...)

  // Scenario 3: Expired code (different precondition → different outcome)
  test('TK-411: should reject discount when code has expired', ...)
});
```

Each test here has a genuinely different scenario, different preconditions, and a different expected outcome.

---

## 5. Assertions Are Micro-Validations During a Flow

Assertions are NOT the purpose of a test. They are **checkpoints** along a flow.

Think of it like this:
- The TEST is the journey (the complete flow)
- ASSERTIONS are road signs along the way (confirming you're on the right path)
- ATCs contain their own assertions (confirming each action succeeded)
- Test-level assertions verify the overall outcome after the flow completes

### Assertion Layers

```
Test Flow
  │
  ├── ATC 1: createOrderSuccessfully()
  │     └── [ATC assertions: status 201, order persisted]
  │
  ├── ATC 2: applyDiscountSuccessfully()
  │     └── [ATC assertions: discount applied, total recalculated]
  │
  └── Test-level assertions:
        └── [Final state: final total matches base - discount, tax applied correctly]
```

The ATC assertions validate that each individual action worked. The test-level assertions validate the overall outcome of combining multiple actions.

---

## 6. Test Files vs ATCs: What Lives Where

### The Relationship

```
TMS (Jira/Xray)                          Code (KATA)
──────────                          ──────────
Test Case ticket (TK-XXX)    ───►   @atc('TK-XXX') method in a Component
                                      │
Integration/E2E ticket (TK-YYY) ─►   test() block in a Test File
                                      │ calls multiple ATCs
                                      └──► ATC 1 + ATC 2 + ATC 3 = complete flow
```

### ATCs = Lego Pieces

ATCs are reusable blocks of actions. They live in **components** (Layer 3) and represent individual acceptance test cases tracked in the TMS. Each ATC has a ticket ID via `@atc('TK-XXX')` and reports its own pass/fail status independently.

### Test Files = Assembled Scenarios

Test files combine ATCs (and helpers) to form **complete scenarios** — integration or E2E flows. A single test may call multiple ATCs. When the test runs, each ATC reports its own result, giving granular visibility into what passed and what failed within the flow.

```
Test File: applyDiscount.test.ts
  │
  └── test('TK-YYY: should apply percentage discount when code is valid')
        │
        ├── [preconditions via helpers]
        ├── ATC: createOrderSuccessfully()       → TK-101 (pass/fail)
        ├── ATC: applyDiscountSuccessfully()     → TK-102 (pass/fail)
        └── [test-level assertions on final state]
```

If `TK-102` fails, the test fails — but the report shows that `TK-101` passed and `TK-102` failed, making debugging precise.

### Traceability in the TMS

The TMS tracks both levels:

| TMS Artifact | Maps To | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Test Case ticket | `@atc('TK-XXX')` in a component | `TK-101: Create order successfully` |
| Integration/E2E ticket | `test()` block in a test file | `TK-411: Apply discount code` |

Both are tickets in your TMS, but they serve different purposes. Test cases validate individual actions. Integration/E2E tickets validate complete flows that combine those actions.

### Ticket ID as Prefix (Required)

Every `test()` block must include the ticket ID as a prefix for direct traceability:

```typescript
// Format: 'TK-XXX: should [behavior] when [condition]'
test('TK-411: should apply percentage discount when code is valid', ...)
test('TK-411: should apply fixed-amount discount when code is valid', ...)
```

The `describe` block can optionally include the ticket ID when the entire file is associated with a single ticket:

```typescript
test.describe('TK-411: Apply Discount Code', () => { ... });
```

This ensures that every test result in the report can be traced back to its corresponding ticket in the TMS.

---

## 7. Preconditions Strategy

Each test sets up its own data via API or DB before executing the test scenario:

```
Test Execution Flow:
  1. Preconditions: Prepare test data via API/DB to create the scenario
  2. Actions: Perform the test steps (API calls or UI interactions)
  3. Assertions: Validate the expected behavior with the given data
```

Rules:
- Each test case creates its own scenario independently
- Tests must NOT depend on or interfere with other tests
- Preconditions are set via API endpoints or DB connection
- Shared environments (staging, dev) are used collaboratively, but data within each test is managed per-test

---

## 8. Integration vs E2E Test Design

| Aspect | Integration Test | E2E Test |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| **Scope** | API endpoint chain (2-3 endpoints) | Full user journey (UI + API) |
| **Speed** | Fast (no browser) | Slower (browser required) |
| **Fixture** | `({ api })` | `({ ui })` or `({ test })` or `({ steps })` |
| **Preconditions** | API calls | API calls (setup) + UI (action) |
| **Value** | Validates business logic correctness | Validates user experience |

Both follow the same principles:
- Complete flows, not isolated checks
- ATCs for actions, helpers for reads
- Multiple assertions per test
- Separate tests only for different scenarios
