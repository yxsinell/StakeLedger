# Smoke Test

> Act as a Senior QA Engineer specialized in smoke testing and post-deployment validation.

---

## Task

**STAGE 2: SMOKE TEST IN STAGING**

Validate that the deployment in staging is functional BEFORE beginning full exploratory testing.

**This prompt is executed IMMEDIATELY** after deployment to staging and BEFORE exploratory-test.md.

> **TCs as Guides**: If Test Cases exist from Stage 1 planning, use them as a guide but explore freely. Update TC statuses (PASSED/FAILED) as you validate. Discovering new scenarios beyond the TCs is expected and encouraged.

---

## Input Required

### 1. Staging Deployment

**Verify:**

- Code deployed to staging
- Staging URL accessible
- CI/CD workflow passed successfully

**Information needed from user:**

- Staging URL: `https://[project]-develop.vercel.app`
- Feature/Story just deployed: `STORY-{PROJECT_KEY}-{ISSUE_NUM}-{name}`

### 2. Current Story

**Read:**

- `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-{PROJECT_KEY}-{ISSUE_NUM}-{name}/stories/STORY-{PROJECT_KEY}-{ISSUE_NUM}-{name}/story.md` - **CRITICAL** - Acceptance criteria
- `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-{PROJECT_KEY}-{ISSUE_NUM}-{name}/stories/STORY-{PROJECT_KEY}-{ISSUE_NUM}-{name}/acceptance-test-plan.md` - Test cases defined (Stage 1)

**What to identify:**

1. What is the happy path of the story?
2. What critical functionality must be validated?
3. Is there backend/auth integration to validate?

### 3. Deployment Context

**Read:**

- `.context/ci-cd-setup.md` - Deployment workflow
- `.context/environment-variables.md` - Staging variables
- `.context/infrastructure-setup.md` - URLs and configuration

---

## Tool Verification (MCP)

**NO MCPs required for this phase.**

### Manual Tools

- Browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari)
- DevTools (F12) to review console/network
- Access to staging URL

---

## Objective

Create smoke test checklist to validate functional deployment:

**Includes:**

- Validate that application loads without 500 errors
- Verify assets load (CSS, JS, images)
- Validate authentication works (if applicable)
- Validate happy path of the story works end-to-end
- Verify integration with backend (APIs, DB)
- Validate basic navigation works

**Does NOT include:**

- Full exploratory testing (that's exploratory-test.md)
- Edge cases or negative testing (that's exploratory testing)
- Automated tests (that's Stage 4: Test Automation)

**Result:** Checklist that QA executes in **5-10 minutes** to confirm functional deployment.

---

- [ ] No 500 or 404 error screen
- [ ] Loading states complete correctly

**2. No errors in console:**

- Open Console tab (F12)
- [ ] No red errors in console
- [ ] Yellow warnings are acceptable (not critical)

**3. Assets load correctly:**

- [ ] CSS loads (page has styles)
- [ ] JavaScript loads (interactions work)
- [ ] Images load (no broken placeholders)

**If something fails here:**

```markdown
## SMOKE TEST FAILED - Basic Access

**Blocker:** [Error description]

**Evidence:**

- Screenshot: [Attach]
- Console errors:

[Capture console errors via [AUTOMATION_TOOL]]

**Action:** Report to Development immediately, DO NOT continue.
```

---

## STEP 3: VALIDATE AUTHENTICATION (If applicable)

**Objective:** Verify that auth flow works.

### Step 3.1: Login

**Action:**

1. Navigate to `/login` (or the login route)
2. Use test credentials:
   - Email: `test@example.com` (or per `.env.example`)
   - Password: `Test123!`

**Validate:**

- [ ] Login form appears correctly
- [ ] Submit login works
- [ ] Redirect to dashboard/home after successful login
- [ ] No errors in console during login

---

### Step 3.2: Session Persistence

**Action:**

1. After successful login, refresh page (F5)

**Validate:**

- [ ] Session persists (doesn't log you out)
- [ ] User info appears correctly (avatar, name, etc.)

---

### Step 3.3: Logout

**Action:**

1. Click on logout button

**Validate:**

- [ ] Logout works
- [ ] Redirect to landing/login page
- [ ] Session is cleared (can't access protected routes)

**If auth fails:**

```markdown
## SMOKE TEST FAILED - Authentication

**Blocker:** [Login/Logout doesn't work]

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. [Step that fails]

**Action:** Report immediately, auth is critical.
```

---

## STEP 4: VALIDATE STORY HAPPY PATH

**Objective:** Verify that main story functionality works.

### Step 4.1: Execute Happy Path

**Action:** Execute the main flow defined in acceptance criteria.

**Example adapted to YOUR story:**

```markdown
### Happy Path: [Flow name per AC]

1. [ ] [First step per acceptance criteria]
2. [ ] [Second step]
3. [ ] [Entity list appears]
4. [ ] [Each card shows: relevant fields]
5. [ ] [Click on entity opens detail]
6. [ ] [Detail shows complete information]

(Where [entities/fields] are determined from your story's AC.
Examples: mentors/skills in MYM, products/price in SHOP, posts/author in BLOG)
```

**For YOUR specific story, adapt the happy path:**

1. **Step 1:** [First AC step]
   - [ ] [What should happen]
   - [ ] [What to validate visually]

2. **Step 2:** [Second AC step]
   - [ ] [What should happen]
   - [ ] [What to validate]

3. **Step 3:** [Third AC step]
   - [ ] [Expected final result]

---

### Step 4.2: Visual Validation

**Visual checklist:**

- [ ] UI looks like designs (colors, spacing, fonts)
- [ ] Components render correctly
- [ ] Responsive design works (resize browser)
- [ ] Loading states are clear
- [ ] No broken layouts or overlapping elements

**If happy path fails:**

```markdown
## SMOKE TEST FAILED - Happy Path

**Blocker:** [Description of what doesn't work]

**Expected:** [What should happen per AC]

**Actual:** [What actually happens]

**Evidence:** [Screenshot or description]

**Action:** Report immediately.
```

---

## STEP 5: VALIDATE BACKEND INTEGRATION

**Objective:** Verify that APIs and DB work.

### Step 5.1: Review Network Tab

**Action:**

1. Open Network tab in DevTools (F12)
2. Execute happy path again
3. Observe requests

**Validate:**

- [ ] API calls to backend return 200 OK (not 500, not 404)
- [ ] Data is sent correctly (payload in request)
- [ ] Data is received correctly (response has expected data)
- [ ] No requests failing continuously

**Validation example:**

```
GET /api/[entities] → 200 OK
Response: { "data": [...entities] }

POST /api/[resources] → 201 Created
Response: { "id": "xxx", "status": "created" }

(Where [entities/resources] depend on your project domain.
Examples: mentors/sessions in MYM, products/orders in SHOP, posts/comments in BLOG)
```

---

### Step 5.2: Validate Data Persistence

**Action (if story modifies data):**

1. Create/modify data via UI (e.g.: create entity, edit profile, etc.)
2. Refresh page (F5)
3. Validate that changes persist

**Validate:**

- [ ] Data saves to DB (persists after refresh)
- [ ] No data loss
- [ ] Data shows correct values

---

## STEP 6: GENERATE SMOKE TEST CHECKLIST

**Objective:** Document smoke test for QA reference.

### Step 6.1: Create File

## Best Practices

### **1. Smoke Test ≠ Exploratory Testing**

**Smoke test (5-10 min):**
- Happy path only
- Validate that deployment works
- Go/No-Go decision

**Exploratory testing (60-90 min):**
- Edge cases
- Negative testing
- UX review
- Full coverage

**Don't confuse:** Smoke test is quick, exploratory testing is deep.

---

### **2. FAILED Smoke Test = STOP**

**If smoke test fails:**
- DO NOT continue with exploratory testing
- DO NOT invest time testing something broken
- Report immediately
- Development fix → Re-deploy → Re-test

**Benefit:** Don't waste QA time on broken deployment.

---

### **3. ALWAYS Validate Backend Integration**

**Even if UI looks good:**
- Check Network tab (F12)
- Validate that APIs return 200
- Validate that data persists

**Why:** UI can render mock/hardcoded data but backend could be broken.

---

### **4. Document Evidence If It Fails**

**If smoke test fails, include:**
- Screenshot of the error
- Console errors (capture via [AUTOMATION_TOOL] console)
- Network tab errors (capture via [AUTOMATION_TOOL] network)
- Exact steps that caused the error

**Benefit:** Development can reproduce and fix faster.

---

### **5. Execute in Different Browsers (If time permits)**

**If you have 2-3 extra minutes:**
- Execute smoke test in Chrome
- Execute in Firefox or Safari

**Why:** Catch browser-specific issues early.
