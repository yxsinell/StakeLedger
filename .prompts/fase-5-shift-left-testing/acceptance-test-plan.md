Act as a QA Engineer expert in Shift-Left Testing, Test Case Design, and Critical Analysis.

**⚠️ WORKFLOW:** This prompt follows the **JIRA-FIRST → LOCAL MIRROR** principle

---

## 📥 Required Input

### 1. Local Story Path (REQUIRED)

**Format:** `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-{PROJECT_KEY}-{ISSUE_NUM}-{name}/stories/STORY-{PROJECT_KEY}-{ISSUE_NUM}-{name}/`
**Example:** `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-UPEX-13-auth/stories/STORY-UPEX-45-login/`

**⚠️ IMPORTANT - Difference Between Naming Conventions:**

- **Local Path (folder):** `STORY-UPEX-45-login` ← Folder naming convention
- **Jira Key (real):** `UPEX-45` ← Real issue key in Jira

**Note:** Issue numbers are identical in both formats (e.g., 45). The difference is only in the STORY- prefix.

**Process:**

1. **User provides:** Local story folder path
2. **Prompt reads:** `story.md` file from that folder
3. **Prompt extracts:** `**Jira Key:**` field from story.md (real format: UPEX-456)
4. **Prompt uses:** That real Jira Key for Atlassian MCP operations

**Path usage:**

- Read local story.md to get real Jira Key
- Read current story from Jira with MCP (Step 5)
- Update story in Jira with refinements (Step 5)
- Add comment with test cases (Step 6)
- Generate acceptance-test-plan.md file in that folder (Step 7)

---

### 2. Business Context (REQUIRED)

- Business Model: [read .context/idea/business-model.md]
- Executive Summary: [read .context/PRD/executive-summary.md]
- User Personas: [read .context/PRD/user-personas.md]
- User Journeys: [read .context/PRD/user-journeys.md]

---

### 3. Technical Context (REQUIRED)

- Functional Specs: [read .context/SRS/functional-specs.md - COMPLETE]
- Non-Functional Specs: [read .context/SRS/non-functional-specs.md]
- Architecture Specs: [read .context/SRS/architecture-specs.md]
- API Contracts: [read .context/SRS/api-contracts.yaml]

---

### 4. Story Context (REQUIRED)

**Step 1: Read Local Story and Extract Jira Keys**

- Story (local): [read {STORY_PATH}/story.md provided by user]
- **Extract from story.md:**
  - `**Jira Key:**` field of the story (e.g., UPEX-456)
  - `**Epic:**` field to get the local epic path
- **Save:** Real Jira Keys to use in MCP operations

**Step 2: Read Local Epic and Extract Epic Jira Key**

- Epic (local): [read epic.md from the epic path found in the story]
- **Extract from epic.md:** `**Jira Key:**` field of the epic (e.g., UPEX-123)
- **Save:** Real Epic Jira Key to read comments

**Step 3: Get Epic from Jira and Comments**

- Epic (Jira): [use Atlassian MCP with real Epic Jira Key extracted]
- **Epic Comments (Jira):** [use Atlassian MCP to read epic comments - look for "Feature Test Plan"]
- Feature Test Plan (local): [read feature-test-plan.md from epic path]

**Step 4: Get Story from Jira**

- Story (Jira): [use Atlassian MCP with real Story Jira Key extracted from step 1]

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Reading epic comments in Jira provides updated context including:

- PO/Dev answers to critical questions
- Additional discussions and clarifications
- Updates to test plan after refinements

---

## 📤 Generated Output

### In Jira (via Atlassian MCP):

1. **Story updated** with refined acceptance criteria and label `shift-left-reviewed`
2. **Comment added** with complete test cases and team tags

### Locally:

1. **File:** `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-{...}/stories/STORY-{...}/acceptance-test-plan.md`
2. **Content:** Exact mirror of the Jira comment

### For User:

1. **Report:** Executive summary with critical questions and next steps (Step 8)

### In Git (Branch Naming Convention):

**Branch format:** `test/{JIRA_ISSUE_KEY}/{short-description}`

**Examples:**

- `test/UPEX-45/user-login-flow`
- `test/UPEX-123/profile-update`
- `test/UPEX-78/checkout-validation`

**Rules:**

1. `test/` prefix required (indicates QA/testing work)
2. Jira Issue Key in uppercase (e.g., UPEX-45) - extracted from `**Jira Key:**` field in story.md
3. Short description in kebab-case (max 3-4 words) - derived from story name
4. Base branch: always `staging` (never `main`)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:**

- This branch should ONLY contain changes to story documentation files (acceptance-test-plan.md)
- DO NOT include production code, testing framework configuration, or implementation
- Branch name should be derived from the analyzed story context

## 🎯 WORKFLOW

This prompt works in **11 steps** (Phase 0 + Steps 0-9) organized in 4 parts, following the **JIRA-FIRST → LOCAL MIRROR** principle:

---

### PHASE 0: TRIAGE (Required First Step)

Before any planning begins, determine whether this ticket needs full testing.

#### Step 0.0: Check Veto Conditions

**Veto conditions bypass risk scoring entirely.** Check these FIRST:

**SKIP TESTING (Code Review only):**

| Condition | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| Backend-only code (no UI exposed) | Internal refactor, server config |
| Infrastructure / DevOps | CI/CD changes, deployment scripts |
| Static content (hardcoded, no API) | Help text updates, legal copy |
| Pure visual / CSS changes | Color adjustments, spacing fixes |
| Documentation only | README updates, inline comments |
| Tech debt refactor | Code reorganization, dependency updates |
| Database setup (no business logic) | Migrations, seed data, index creation |

**REQUIRE TESTING (regardless of score):**

| Condition | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| Affects money / billing | Payment flows, invoicing, pricing |
| Affects data integrity | CRUD on core entities, cascading deletes |
| Auth / Authorization | Login, permissions, role changes |
| External integrations | Third-party APIs, webhooks |
| Bug in critical module | Fix for a high-severity production bug |
| Calculations / formulas | Business logic, aggregations, reports |

- If a **SKIP** veto applies → Perform lightweight Code Review only (verify fix in code, add comment to ticket, no test cases)
- If a **REQUIRE** veto applies → Proceed to Full Testing (skip risk scoring)
- If no veto applies → Calculate Risk Score below

#### Step 0.1: Calculate Risk Score (if no veto)

| Factor | Score | Condition |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| New feature | +3 | New functionality (vs change to existing) |
| Data from API/DB | +3 | Uses dynamic data (vs hardcoded/static) |
| Has explicit ACs | +2 | Acceptance criteria are defined |
| User-facing | +2 | Affects UI or user-visible behavior |
| High effort | +2 | Person-hours > 4 |
| High priority | +1 | Priority = High or Critical |
| Multi-component | +1 | Multiple areas of codebase affected |

**Score interpretation:**

| Score | Risk Level | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 0-3 | LOW | Code Review only (same as SKIP veto) |
| 4-7 | MEDIUM | Full Testing (standard workflow) |
| 8+ | HIGH | Full Testing + extended edge case coverage |

**Present triage result to user before proceeding.**

#### Step 0.2: Data Feasibility Check (if Full Testing)

> **Reference**: `.context/guidelines/TAE/test-data-management.md`

For each Acceptance Criterion, assess whether test data is obtainable:

| AC | Precondition Needed | Data Found? | Pattern | Notes |
|----|---------------------|-------------|---------|-------|
| AC1 | {state needed} | Yes / No | Discover / Modify / Generate | {entity found or issue} |

If no data can be obtained for a critical precondition → Flag as **risk** in the test plan.

---

**Parametrized Test Group 2:** [If applicable]

- **Base Scenario:** ...
- **Parameters to Vary:** ...
- **Test Data Sets:** [Similar table]

---

**If No Parametrization:**
[Explain why not recommended - e.g., scenarios are too different, no common pattern, etc.]

---

### Test Outline Naming Convention (Shift-Left)

**Context:** In Shift-Left Testing, test cases are **Test Outlines** - guides for exploratory testing, not formal test cases. Naming is simpler than in Test Documentation (Stage 3).

**Format:**

```
Should <BEHAVIOR> <CONDITION>
```

**Component definitions:**

| Component   | What it is                                                       | Examples                                                                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BEHAVIOR`  | **The main behavior** being validated (verb + object)            | `login successfully`, `display error`, `create user`, `calculate total`               |
| `CONDITION` | **The condition or context** that makes this scenario unique     | `with valid credentials`, `when field is empty`, `for premium users`, `at limit`      |

**Mental formula:**

```
"Should [WHAT behavior] [UNDER WHAT condition]"
```

**Examples by test type:**

| Type     | BEHAVIOR                     | CONDITION                              | Full Title                                                   |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Positive | `login successfully`         | `with valid credentials`               | Should login successfully with valid credentials             |
| Negative | `display authentication error` | `when password is incorrect`         | Should display authentication error when password is incorrect |
| Boundary | `accept character limit`     | `when entering exactly 50 chars`       | Should accept character limit when entering exactly 50 chars |
| Edge     | `handle cart behavior`       | `when there are multiple same items`   | Should handle cart behavior when there are multiple same items |

**Anti-patterns (avoid):**

| ❌ Incorrect          | ✅ Correct                                                | Why                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `Login test`          | `Should login successfully with valid credentials`        | Missing specific BEHAVIOR and CONDITION |
| `Login - error`       | `Should display authentication error with invalid password` | Too vague, doesn't describe context   |
| `Test the form`       | `Should submit form with all fields`                      | Doesn't indicate what behavior          |
| `Negative case`       | `Should reject registration when email already exists`    | Doesn't describe the scenario           |

**Note:** In Stage 3 (Test Documentation), the prefix `<TS_ID>: TC#:` is added for formal test cases in Jira/Xray. See `.context/guidelines/QA/jira-test-management.md`.

### Data Categories

| Data Type       | Count | Purpose         | Examples               |
| --------------- | ----- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Valid data      | [X]   | Positive tests  | [Specific examples]    |
| Invalid data    | [Y]   | Negative tests  | [Specific examples]    |
| Boundary values | [Z]   | Boundary tests  | [min, max, empty, null]|
| Edge case data  | [W]   | Edge case tests | [Specific examples]    |

### Data Generation Strategy

**Static Test Data:**
[Data that is hardcoded because it's critical/specific]

- [Example 1]
- [Example 2]

**Dynamic Test Data (using Faker.js):**
[Data that is dynamically generated]

- User data: `faker.internet.email()`, `faker.person.firstName()`
- Numbers: `faker.number.int({ min: X, max: Y })`
- Dates: `faker.date.recent()`

**Test Data Cleanup:**

- ✅ All test data is cleaned up after test execution
- ✅ Tests are idempotent (can run multiple times)
- ✅ Tests do not depend on execution order

---

## 📝 PART 2: Integration and Output

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This part implements the **JIRA-FIRST → LOCAL MIRROR** flow to maintain consistency with the story management process.

---

### Step 5: Update Story in Jira

**Objective:** Refine the story in Jira WITH refinements identified in Step 2, BEFORE generating test cases.

**Tool:** Atlassian MCP

**Steps to execute:**

1. **Read current story from Jira:**
   - Use Atlassian MCP to get the issue
   - Input: Real Jira Key extracted from story.md (e.g., UPEX-45)
   - ⚠️ **DO NOT use** folder naming convention (STORY-UPEX-45)
   - Get: current description, acceptance criteria

2. **Prepare refined content:**

   Based on Step 2 analysis, prepare:
   - **Refined Acceptance Criteria** (from Step 3)
   - **Identified Edge Cases** (from Step 2)
   - **Clarified Business Rules** (from Step 2)

3. **Update story in Jira:**
   - Use Atlassian MCP to edit the issue
   - Add new section to description with the following content:

   ---

   ## 🧪 QA Refinements (Shift-Left Analysis)

   **Analysis Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
   **Status:** Refined by QA

   ### Refined Acceptance Criteria

   [Insert refined scenarios from Step 3 above]

   ### Edge Cases Identified

   [List edge cases from Step 2]

---

**Format:** Structured Markdown following **JIRA-FIRST → LOCAL MIRROR** flow

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites to Execute This Prompt

- ✅ ALL context files (idea, PRD, SRS) must be complete
- ✅ Feature test plan must exist
- ✅ Local Story.md must exist
- ✅ **Local Story Path available** (e.g., `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-UPEX-13-name/stories/STORY-UPEX-45-name/`)
- ✅ **Story.md must contain `Jira Key:` field** with real key (e.g., UPEX-45)
- ✅ **Epic.md must contain `Jira Key:` field** with real epic key (e.g., UPEX-13)
- ✅ **Atlassian MCP access configured and working**

```

These are the real data. Note: The issue number (45, 13) is the same in folder naming convention and in Jira Key.

---

## 📋 Execution Flow (For AI)

### Step 0: Create working branch

**Objective:** Create a specific branch for Shift-Left Testing work before generating test cases.

**Steps to execute:**

1. Checkout from `staging`: `git checkout staging && git pull`
2. Create branch using format: `test/{JIRA_KEY}/{short-description}`
3. `{JIRA_KEY}` is extracted from `**Jira Key:**` field in story.md
4. `{short-description}` is derived from story name/title in kebab-case (max 3-4 words)

**Example:**

```bash
git checkout staging && git pull
git checkout -b test/UPEX-45/user-login-flow
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This branch will only contain the generated `acceptance-test-plan.md` file. DO NOT include other changes.

---

### Required user input:

```
Story Path: .context/PBI/epics/EPIC-UPEX-13-name/stories/STORY-UPEX-45-name/
```

**⚠️ Automatic Process:**

1. Prompt reads: `{STORY_PATH}/story.md`
2. Prompt extracts: `**Jira Key:**` field (e.g., UPEX-45)
3. Prompt extracts: `**Epic:**` field to find epic path
4. Prompt reads: Epic.md and extracts Epic Jira Key (e.g., UPEX-13)
5. Prompt uses: Real Jira Keys for MCP operations

### Execution order:

**Step 0: Create working branch**

1. Read `{STORY_PATH}/story.md` provided by user
2. Extract `**Jira Key:**` field from story (e.g., UPEX-45)
3. Derive `{short-description}` from story title in kebab-case
4. Execute: `git checkout staging && git pull`
5. Create branch: `git checkout -b test/{JIRA_KEY}/{short-description}`

**Prerequisite: Extract Jira Keys**
6. Extract `**Epic:**` field to get epic path
7. Read epic.md and extract Epic Jira Key (e.g., UPEX-13)
8. Save both real Jira Keys for Steps 5 and 6

**Read Complete Context:**
9. Read all context files (PRD, SRS, local epic.md, feature-test-plan.md, story.md)
10. Read current story from Jira with MCP (using real Story Jira Key)
11. Read epic from Jira with MCP (using real Epic Jira Key)
12. **Read epic comments in Jira** - especially "Feature Test Plan"

**PART 1 - Analysis and Design:**
13. **Step 1:** Critical Analysis (includes Epic-Level Context from comments)
14. **Step 2:** Story Quality Analysis
15. **Step 3:** Refined Acceptance Criteria
16. **Step 4:** Test Design

**PART 2 - Integration and Output:**
17. **Step 5:** Update story in Jira with refinements (MCP + real Story Jira Key)
18. **Step 6:** Create comment in Jira with complete test cases (MCP + real Story Jira Key)
19. **Step 7:** Generate local `acceptance-test-plan.md` file in {STORY_PATH}/ (Write tool)
20. **Step 8:** Report summary to user (Output)
21. **Step 9:** Commit `acceptance-test-plan.md` file in working branch

### Tools to use:

**Git (Bash):**

- For checkout from `staging` and pull recent changes
- For creating working branch with format `test/{JIRA_KEY}/{short-description}`
- For committing generated `acceptance-test-plan.md` file

**Atlassian MCP:**

- To read story from Jira
- To read epic from Jira (updated description)
- **To read epic comments in Jira** (especially "Feature Test Plan")
- To update story description and labels
- To add comments to issues

**File Operations:**

- To create local acceptance-test-plan.md file
- To read context files (PRD, SRS, epic, feature-test-plan, story.md)

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Execution Principles

### Shift-Left Testing Philosophy:

- ✅ **Critical analysis first, test design second**
- ✅ **Early feedback is MORE valuable than perfect test cases**
- ✅ **Refine the story BEFORE implementation** (shift-left!)
- ✅ **Exploratory test cases = Jira comments** (not separate issues)
- ✅ **Epic context is critical** - ALWAYS read epic comments in Jira to get:
  - Already identified risks
  - Questions already answered by PO/Dev
  - Critical integration points
  - Updates after initial test plan

### Test Design Guidelines:

- ❌ **DO NOT force minimum number of test cases** - depends on complexity
- ✅ **Use parametrization when applicable** - reduces duplication
- ✅ **Identify edge cases NOT covered** in original story
- ✅ **Ask critical questions to PO/Dev** - better to clarify than assume

### Jira-First Workflow:

- ✅ **ALWAYS update Jira first, then local** (consistency with story flow)
- ✅ **Test cases go in comments, NOT subtasks** (exploratory nature)
- ✅ **Tag the team** (@PO, @Dev, @QA) for visibility
- ✅ **Add label `shift-left-reviewed`** for tracking

---

## 🎯 Post-Generation: Team Actions

### Immediately after executing this prompt:

1. **PO must:**
   - Review comment in Jira with test cases
   - Answer "Critical Questions for PO" in Step 8
   - Validate "Suggested Story Improvements"
   - Confirm expected behavior for identified edge cases

2. **Dev must:**
   - Review comment in Jira with test cases
   - Answer "Technical Questions for Dev" in Step 8
   - Validate integration points and test approach
   - **DO NOT start implementation** until critical questions are resolved

3. **QA must:**
   - Wait for PO/Dev answers
   - Update test cases based on feedback
   - Prepare test environment

4. **User (who executed the prompt) must:**
   - Share Jira story link with team
   - Facilitate critical questions discussion
   - Ensure questions are answered before sprint

---

## 🚀 Test Cases Evolution (Post Shift-Left)

### Options to formalize test cases:

Once PO/Dev have clarified all questions and story is refined:

**Option A: Keep in comments** (Recommended for simple stories)

- Test cases stay in Jira comment
- Local file serves as documentation
- QA executes from local file or comment

**Option B: Migrate to Xray/Zephyr** (For complex or critical stories)

- Create Test Set/Suite in test management tool
- Link with story using "IsTestedBy"
- Keep local file as mirror

**Option C: Automate** (Once test cases are stable)

- Use test cases as base for automation scripts
- Generate tests with Playwright/Cypress based on acceptance-test-plan.md
- Integrate into CI/CD pipeline

---

## 🔄 Integrated Workflow: Epic ↔ Story Context

### Information Flow:

```
1. Epic Test Plan generated → Comment in Epic (Jira)
                           ↓
2. PO/Dev answer questions in Epic comments
                           ↓
3. Acceptance Test Plan reads Epic comments
                           ↓
4. Acceptance Test Plan inherits context:
   - Identified risks
   - Already answered questions
   - Integration points
   - Test strategy
                           ↓
5. Acceptance Test Plan focuses on story-specific gaps
                           ↓
6. Comment added to Story (Jira) with test cases
                           ↓
7. PO/Dev answer story-specific questions
                           ↓
8. Implementation starts with complete context
```

**Benefits of this flow:**

- ✅ **Avoids duplication** of questions between epic and stories
- ✅ **Cumulative context** - each story inherits knowledge from epic
- ✅ **Full traceability** - everything documented in Jira comments
- ✅ **Improved collaboration** - PO/Dev see analysis evolution
- ✅ **Informed decisions** - Dev implements with complete risk context

## 📚 Testing Artifacts Hierarchy (IQL)

This prompt generates artifacts that follow the **Integrated Quality Lifecycle** hierarchy:

### IQL Artifacts

| Artifact                       | Level | Description                            | IQL Phase         |
| ------------------------------ | ----- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **FTP** (Feature Test Plan)    | Epic  | Testing strategy and scope             | Early-Game Step 1 |
| **ATP** (Acceptance Test Plan) | Story | This document - plan to validate ACs   | Early-Game Step 1 |
| **ATC** (Acceptance Test Case) | Test  | Individual cases documented in Jira    | Mid-Game Step 6   |

> **Note:** FTP and ATP are BOTH created in Step 1 (Requirements Analysis). First the Epic is analyzed to create FTP (macro context), then Stories are analyzed to create ATPs informed by FTP.

### KATA: Automation Architecture

**KATA** (Component Action Test Architecture) **is not an IQL artifact**, but the native automation architecture:

- Used in Mid-Game (Steps 8-10) to automate ATCs
- The `@atc('PROJECT-XXX')` decorator links scripts with Jira tickets
- Provides bidirectional traceability between code and test management

**Full traceability:**

```
Epic (Jira)
  ↓ [Step 1a] FTP (Feature Test Plan) → Macro context
Story (Jira + .md)
  ↓ [Step 1b] ATP (Acceptance Test Plan) → This document (informed by FTP)
  ↓ AC → Refined Acceptance Criteria
ATCs (Acceptance Test Cases) → Step 6
  ↓ Documented in Jira as Test tickets
  ↓ Each ATC maps 1:1 with Jira ticket
KATA Automation → Steps 8-10
  ↓ @atc('PROJECT-XXX') decorator
  ↓ Automated scripts with traceability
```

**Connection with Mid-Game:**

The "Test Outlines" generated in this ATP become **formal ATCs** during Mid-Game Step 6. Each ATC:

- Is documented as 'Test' ticket in Jira/Xray
- Is evaluated for automation (Step 7)
- Is automated with KATA architecture (Steps 8-10)

See documentation:

- [IQL Methodology](docs/testing/test-architecture/IQL-methodology.md)
- [Mid-Game Testing](docs/testing/test-architecture/mid-game-testing.md)
- [KATA Fundamentals](docs/testing/test-architecture/kata-fundamentals.md)

## 📤 JIRA SYNC (Conditional - UPEX Workspace)

### Custom Field for Acceptance Test Plan

| Field ID            | Name                        | Type     | Level |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | -------- | ----- |
| `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan_atp}}` | Acceptance Test Plan (QA)🧪 | Textarea | Story |

### Sync Instructions

**AFTER generating the `acceptance-test-plan.md` file locally:**

1. **Check if Story has the custom field:**
   - Use Atlassian MCP to get Story: `jira_get_issue`
   - Check if `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan_atp}}` exists and is available in response

2. **If field exists:**
   - Copy COMPLETE content from generated `acceptance-test-plan.md`
   - Update Story in Jira using MCP `jira_update_issue`:
     ```
     fields: {
       "{{jira.acceptance_test_plan_atp}}": "[acceptance-test-plan.md content]"
     }
     ```
   - Add label: `test-plan-ready`

3. **If field does NOT exist (non-UPEX Workspace):**
   - Look for equivalent field with similar name ("Test Plan", "QA Plan", "Acceptance Tests")
   - If no equivalent field exists, add as **comment** in Story:

     ```
     🧪 **Acceptance Test Plan (QA)**

     [acceptance-test-plan.md content]
     ```

### Expected Output

- [ ] `acceptance-test-plan.md` file created in `.context/PBI/epics/.../stories/.../`
- [ ] Custom field `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan_atp}}` updated in Jira (if exists)
- [ ] Label `test-plan-ready` added to Story
- [ ] Comment added as fallback (if field doesn't exist)
